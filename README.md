# Cloned Google homepage
Just a replicate of the google homepage (just the front-end part of it ofc xD), Only pure HTML5 and CSS3 were used.
One of things that got me stuck for like one hour is I forgot that my nav element is nested whitin the header element, and I put display:grid on the header selector (which only contains one element),
Which doesn't work ofc so I had to use the dev tools and hunting the ghosts :p, And nope I didn't find it using the dev tools, it was just a coincidence, i was like
okay ... -_-, I know it's such a foolish thing to get stuck with, but hey, I figured it out at the end :3.
